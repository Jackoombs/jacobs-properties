## A Review of the Key Trends in the National and Local Housing Market

### Market recalibration

Price moderation and a sales slowdown are likely over the coming months but should be considered in the
context of economic history, the frenzied post-pandemic
market and the longer-term outlook.

#### The market in context

The Autumn Statement provided a
sobering assessment of the UK
economy, but forecasts for the housing
market are less dramatic than during
1989–1993 and the Global Financial Crisis
in 2007/8. Inflation is expected to peak
during the final quarter of 2022 before
falling back over the course of 2023, and
unemployment looks likely to remain
lower than the 10-year average (5.3%).

The Global Financial Crisis, caused by
banks lending more than borrowers
could afford to pay, led to the more
stringent mortgage lending criteria
imposed since 2014. Today, only an
estimated 4.2% of homeowners have
less than 10% equity in their home.

#### Price correction

Property price growth is moderating
and price correction is forecast. At 7.2%
in the year to October, annual price
growth remains considerably stronger
than the 3.3% average between 2010
and 2019. Since June 2020, average
property prices have risen by close to
£50,000, the equivalent of 24%, with
lockdown and lifestyle changes spurring
the market. Single-digit price correction
is predicted for 2023/2024 before price
growth is anticipated to return in 2025.
Buyers will continue to benefit from the
0% rate of stamp duty up to £250,000
until March 2025. With almost one in
three movers ‘needs-based’, such
buyers will present sales opportunities.

#### Rises and cuts

The Autumn Statement confirmed a
raft of spending cuts across Whitehall
and tax rises through changes and
freezes to tax thresholds. At 5.7% in
the year to September, wage growth
is at its fastest in over 20 years, but the
conflict in Ukraine continues to
impact energy costs and food prices,
and a package of measures remains
to support the most vulnerable.
Expectations for interest rates, gilts
and swap rates are up to 1% better
than in the immediate aftermath of
the ‘Growth Plan’, although mortgage
rates of 5% to 6% will be usual for
those seeking to purchase or
remortgage.

### Rent increases

Demand for quality rental housing
continues across the UK. A shortage of
stock and additional demand from
prospective buyers, who may well rent in
the short term as opposed to buy,
continues to fuel prices. Average rents in
the UK rose again in October to £1,171.
Excluding London, average monthly rents
now stand at £976. Annual rental growth
in Scotland has doubled in the past year,
with emergency legislation passed by the
Scottish Government to freeze rents and
evictions for both the private and social
rented sectors until at least 21 March 2023.

2023 will inevitably prove a very different housing market to 2022 but there will still be buyers who need to buy, and sellers who need to sell. Over the longer term,forecasts for growth remain positive.

### Calculating Energy Costs - What Costs Watt?

#### Calculating energy use

The average household uses
1,000kWh of gas and 241kWh of
electricity per month
, but being
smarter and more efficient with
energy is everyone’s goal this winter.
Smart meters are helping many keep
track of their spend, and it is possible
to estimate how much energy any
appliance uses, by multiplying its
power rating in kW by how long
(minutes/hours) it is on.

#### Turn down, turn off

Alongside heating, the most
expensive home appliances are often
electric showers, washing machines
and tumble dryers. Cutting down on
shower time, ensuring loads are full,
and using a lower temperature and/or
a shorter cycle can all help. Although
computers, TVs and stereos are less
energy-guzzling, turning appliances
off standby mode and not leaving
laptops or mobile phones on charge
unnecessarily will all save money.

#### Calculating energy use

Air fryers and slow cookers are
considered the most energy-efficient
ways to cook, while a microwave
uses up to 80% less energy than a
conventional oven. Induction hobs
use energy more efficiently than a
gas or electric ceramic hob;
traditional ovens are considered the
costliest way to cook. An energy-efficient (A-rated) fridge-freezer
could save close to £70 a year
compared to one rated D.

### National Market Conditions

Annual price growth in the UK has
moderated back from the double-digit
price growth that has epitomised the
market in recent months, with all major
indices placing growth firmly in single
digits as the year draws to a close. Average
asking prices fell by 1.1% in November
compared to October, with all regions
experiencing a slight fall (Rightmove).

Buyer demand is returning to
pre-pandemic norms, with mortgage
approvals in recent months slowing
(Bank of England). Realistic pricing for
market conditions will be paramount in
achieving a sale as the market recalibrates

### Regional Activity

2022 is set to be the busiest market
since 2017, with the exception of 2021.
Zoopla estimates there are around
293,000 sales currently in the pipeline
to be completed before the end of the
year. Sales volumes are predicted to
be around 1 million in 2023, a level
more on par with the pre-pandemic
norm (Zoopla, JLL). October saw a 13%
uptick in new supply to the market
compared to a year ago, although
stock levels remain low by historic
standards (RICS).

Across the South West and South
East the time taken to sell a property
has nudged upwards over the past
month. However, at 37 and 41 days
respectively, they remain considerably
less than 65 and 69 days in October
2019 (Rightmove). Swindon and Hart
are currently the most active property
markets in the region.
