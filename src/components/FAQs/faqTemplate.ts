      question: "What are the costs when buying/selling a property?",
      answer: `
•	Estate Agents fee. The percentage of your sale price paid to your Agent is agreed when you sign the contract at the start of the process.

•	Stamp Duty Land Tax for your purchase – 
If it is going to be the only property you own:
Up to £250,000 – zero.
The next £675,000 (the portion from £250,001 to £925,000) – 5%
The next £575,000 (the portion from £925,001 to £1.5 million – 10%
The remaining amount (the portion above £1.5 million) – 12%

If you’re buying your first home:
No SDLT up to £425,000
5% SDLT on the portion from £425,001 to £625,000
If the price is over £625,000 you cannot claim the relief for first time buyers. You would pay the amounts for all purchases

•	You can use a useful calculator.

•	Deposit – the amount you put towards the cost of the property when buying. Generally the larger the deposit the more likely you are able to be given a mortgage, subject to affordability criteria, this will then have an impact on the interest rate you can be given. On average you will need at least 5% to 20% of the purchase price. Speak to a mortgage advisor and obtain a mortgage offer in principle before offering on a property.

•	Solicitors Fees (local search fees also), you would ask for a quote before you instruct one
•	Removal costs
•	Homebuyers survey of the property you purchase, if you decide to have one
•	Mortgage valuation survey – check with your lender
•	EPC (see below)

      question: "How long does it take to buy a property?",
      answer: `
When it comes to buying or selling a property, one of the most frequently asked questions is how long does it take to exchange contracts? Unfortunately, there is no set answer to this question as it can vary from property to property and depend on individual circumstances. However, on average, it usually takes around 8-12 weeks before contracts are exchanged. 

During this time, there are a number of factors that can affect the timeline, such as the length of the chain, the speed of the conveyancing process, and any issues that may arise during the survey or search process. It is important to remain patient during this time and work closely with your solicitor and estate agent to ensure a smooth and timely exchange of contracts.

    },
    {
      question: "At what point do I need to arrange a mortgage?",
      answer: `
      When it comes to buying a property, it's essential to have a solid financial plan in place from the outset. That's why we highly recommend that any prospective buyer seek financial advice early on in the process. This advice can help you understand your budget, your options for financing, and the associated costs and risks of buying a property.
      
      In addition to seeking advice, it's also important to obtain a mortgage in principle. This document shows the seller that you have already been approved for a certain amount of financing, which can give you an edge over other buyers who have not yet secured their financing. Overall, taking these steps early on in the buying process can help you make a more informed and confident decision, and put you in a stronger position when it comes to negotiating with sellers.

    {
      question: "Will I need to get a survey before I purchase the property?",
      answer: `
When you apply for a mortgage, your lender will usually require a property valuation to be carried out on their behalf. This is to ensure that the property is worth the amount that you are borrowing. However, it is important to note that a basic valuation does not provide a detailed inspection of the property's condition. Therefore, it is highly recommended that you obtain a full condition report from a chartered surveyor.

This report will provide you with a more comprehensive understanding of the property's condition and any potential issues that may need to be addressed. It will also give you peace of mind that you are making a sound investment. Without a full condition report, any problems that arise with the property after exchange of contracts are the responsibility of the buyer. So, it's essential to have a professional inspection done to avoid any unpleasant surprises down the line.

    {
      question:
        "What do I do if the surveyor finds an issue with the property?",
      answer: `
When purchasing a property, it is important to thoroughly inspect the property before exchanging contracts. If a problem is discovered during the inspection, it is important to determine the best course of action. One option is to request that the seller pays for and corrects the problem before the exchange of contracts. Another option is to seek a price reduction that would cover the cost of resolving the problem. 

If neither option is agreeable, it may be necessary to withdraw from the purchase. It is important to remember that once the contracts have been exchanged, the sale is legally binding and it may be difficult to resolve any issues that arise. Therefore, it is important to address any problems before the exchange of contracts occurs.
        `,
    },
    {
      question: "What if I want to pull out of my property purchase?",
      answer: `
In many legal systems, it is common for either party to withdraw from a transaction prior to the exchange of contracts. This means that until the contracts are signed, both parties have the right to back out of the deal without any consequences. However, once the contracts have been exchanged, the situation changes. At this point, the suffering party is entitled to breach of contract remedies if the other party fails to fulfill their obligations. This means that if the seller breaches the contract, the buyer is entitled to compensation for any losses they have suffered. 

In such cases, the seller may be able to keep the buyer's deposit as a form of compensation for their losses. It is important for both parties to carefully consider the terms of the contract before exchanging it and to seek legal advice if necessary.

      question: "Why sell through Jacobs?",
      answer: `
Most houses are freehold (some shared ownership may not be), so the freeholder owns it outright, including the land it is built on. You are responsible for maintain your property and land.

With a leasehold, you own the property for the length of your lease agreement term with the freeholder. Most flats/maisonettes are leasehold, so you own the property in the building but not the actual building or land. This means that the freeholder is, normally, responsible for the maintenance and repair of the building. 

Some houses might be sold as leasehold, if this is the case then you own the property, but not the land it is on.

When you buy a leasehold property, you’ll take over the lease from the previous owner. Before making an offer consider;
•	How many years left on the lease
•	Budget for service and maintenance charges, including any future increases that are written into the contract
•	How the length of the lease might affect getting a mortgage and the resale value

When buying a leasehold property, it is important to consider the length of the  remaining term of the lease. As time passes, the value of the property is affected by the diminishing term of the lease which could make the property more difficult to sell. Typically it is a good idea that the lease has at least 80 years remaining, or you might struggle to get a mortgage.

      answer:
        "The date set for you to move into the property, known as ‘completion’, will be agreed with your seller during the sales process. This date is usually confirmed by the Solicitors in conjunction with estate agent. We recommend at least one week between exchange and completion to give all parties time to pack etc.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between exchange and completion?",
      answer: `
Exchanging contracts before your purchase is legally binding, so be certain you want to go ahead before signing anything. Normally the following should be completed in preparation for exchange;
•	check the searches are complete
•	check you have your mortgage offer in writing 
•	check you have the funds for your mortgage deposit
•	make sure you’ve agreed on a completion date for sale
•	check the contract your solicitor will send before signing and returning it
•	ask your solicitor to explain any conditions or terms you don’t understand 
•	keep in regular contact to prevent any hold-ups in processing the paperwork 
•	make sure you know what’s included in the offer, e.g. fixtures and fittings, and have it put in writing
•	check you have funds for a holding or contract deposit if the seller requires one (typically £500 to £1,000)
•	if the seller pulls out before you exchange contracts, you have no legal right to recover any costs from them, though you can take out indemnity insurance to cover wasted costs – your solicitor can advise you about this 
•	check the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) for your new home - this rates the energy efficiency of the building
•	if sellers attempt to renegotiate the purchase price at this stage, get advice from your solicitor and ask them to help you with the negotiations
•	organise buildings insurance and make sure it’s valid from your exchange date. 

Completion - this is the date when you can move into your new home. The estate agent is likely to hold the keys for you to pick up. 
•	On completion day, your solicitor will arrange for money to be transferred to the seller’s solicitor.
•	Ideally, all the buyers and sellers in the chain complete on the same day, otherwise you might have to wait for the seller to have completed buying their new home before you can move in.

      question:
        "I want to let my property. Do I need to tell my mortgage lender?",

Yes, it is very important to inform your mortgage lender when you are letting your property. As a landlord, you must seek permission from your mortgage lender before you let your property out to tenants. Most mortgage lenders will have a clause in the mortgage agreement which states that you must inform them if you are planning to let your property. 

It is important to seek permission as your mortgage lender may charge a fee for letting or impose other restrictions. Additionally, you should also check your insurance policy as some policies may not cover rented properties. By informing your mortgage lender that you are letting your property, you are protecting yourself from any potential liability.

      question: "What happens to my tenant's deposit?",
      answer: `
As a landlord, it can be concerning and frustrating to find out that your tenant has fallen behind on rent payments. However, the first step should always be to talk to the tenant directly. A simple phone call or text message can often serve as a gentle reminder, and following up with a letter or email can provide a paper trail in case the situation escalates. 

It is also important to remember that both landlords and tenants have obligations in this type of situation. If the tenant is experiencing financial difficulties, it may be worth discussing a payment plan to help them catch up in the short term. Ultimately, open communication is key to resolving issues related to rent arrears and maintaining a positive landlord-tenant relationship in the long-term. It may be necessary to serve a section 8 or 21 notice should the rent arrears not be resolved.

At Jacobs Properties we have set procedures for dealing with rent arrears.

An Energy Performance Certificate, or EPC for short, is a report detailing the energy efficiency of a property. It gives a property an energy efficiency rating from A (most efficient) to G (least efficient) and is valid for 10 years.

All landlords are required to purchase an EPC for a property before they let it and currently the property must have a minimum rating of E on its EPC. It is unlawful to rent a property which breaches this requirement with potential penalty fines being issued for non-compliance. There are certain situations where exemption may granted.

There is a government proposal that in 2025 let properties will require a minimum rating of C. However, this has yet to be made law.

      question: "How can I improve my EPC rating?",
      answer: `
Improving your property's Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) rating is not only beneficial for the environment, but it can also add value to your property. Fortunately, there are a few easy and cost-effective ways to upgrade your property's rating. One of the simplest changes you can make is to switch to energy-saving light bulbs. This small change can make a significant difference in reducing your energy consumption and improving your EPC rating. 

Another important factor to consider is insulation. Ensure that your loft insulation is at least 270mm thick, and if you have cavity walls, make sure they are filled with insulation too. Proper insulation can help reduce heat loss, lower your energy bills, and improve your EPC rating. 

However, if you are willing to invest more money into improving your EPC rating, there are more expensive options available. Replacing an old, inefficient boiler with a new energy-efficient one can significantly improve your rating. Additionally, adding modern controls like room thermostats can help you control your heating more efficiently. Finally, adding renewable technologies like solar panels to your property can help you generate your own energy and further improve your EPC rating. 

In conclusion, there are numerous ways to improve your property's EPC rating. Whether you opt for simple and cost-effective changes or invest in more expensive upgrades, you can make a significant difference in reducing your carbon footprint and increasing your property's value.

Your EPC report will make recommendations on how your property rating can be improved and the potential grade it can reach by carrying out these improvements.

      question: "Do I need smoke alarms in my property?",
      answer: `
As of 1 October 2015, UK legislation required landlords in England to take an important safety measure for their rental properties. This legislation stated that landlords must install smoke alarms in all of their rented residential accommodations (in the correct areas). The legislation was further expanded as of 1 October 2022, making it mandatory for landlords to install carbon monoxide alarms in any room with a fuel burning appliance. 

It is crucial to note that the legislation also requires landlords to act when tenants report a faulty alarm to them. This means that landlords must act quickly to ensure that any faulty smoke or carbon monoxide alarms are repaired or replaced. Failure to comply with the law can result in hefty fines. Therefore, it is important for landlords to ensure that their rental properties comply with the law to avoid any potential legal issues.

      question: "What is Right to Rent?",
      answer: `
The Right to Rent scheme is a crucial aspect of renting property in the UK. It ensures that tenants have a legal right to be in the country and helps landlords avoid any potential legal issues. The scheme was rolled out across England in February 2016 and has since become an integral part of the referencing process. At Jacobs Properties, we have been conducting Right to Rent checks for our clients for many years. 

However, if a landlord decides to carry out their own checks, they will now need to obtain an acceptable proof of residency for their tenants. Failure to do so can result in hefty fines. If you do not currently handle tenant checks, we are more than happy to discuss how we can assist you with this process. Our team of experts will ensure that all necessary checks are carried out quickly and efficiently, giving you peace of mind and helping you to avoid any legal complications.

      answer: `
Before you start searching for your new home it’s a good idea to write down a budget. What are your current outgoings and what money do you have left each month to spend on rent? As well as the rent, consider any other costs involved in moving home and renting a property including deposits, household bills and removal costs.
Once you know your budget, your ideal location and tenancy start date, register with Jacobs Properties and we will begin to help you with your search.

      question: "What if there are problems with my reference?",

Obvious examples are students without a regular income, or someone leaving their family home for the first time with no renting history.
